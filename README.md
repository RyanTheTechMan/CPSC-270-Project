# RC App - College Student Hub

RC App is a one-stop college student app that combines multiple essential features and services into a single, unified, and easy-to-use platform. Our aim is to make students' lives simpler and more efficient by providing them with an intuitive interface to access all their academic, financial, and social needs. The current name, "RC App," is temporary as this concept demo was built specifically for Roanoke College.
